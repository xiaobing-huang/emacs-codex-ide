Codex IDE for Emacs is a pure Emacs Codex client, inspired by [claude-code-ide.el](https://github.com/manzaltu/claude-code-ide.el).

This package provides native integration with `codex app-server` which, unlike terminal-based wrappers, renders Codex sessions as normal Emacs buffers and keeps the interaction surface fully inside Emacs.

## Overview

### Features

- Runs Codex as an Emacs major mode with no terminal wrapper.
- Renders code blocks with full Emacs major-mode syntax highlighting instead of terminal-style formatting.
- Displays diffs using Emacs diff rendering, so patches look and read like they belong in Emacs, including a canonical session diff buffer that can follow live work or transcript position.
- Turns Codex file and code references into clickable Emacs widgets that jump straight to real buffers.
- Keeps approvals in-buffer with an interactive review flow for confirming commands and changes without leaving the session.
- Lets you expand or collapse transcript detail, so you can skim the headline progress or inspect the full turn-by-turn output.
- Uses MCP integration to give Codex awareness of your live Emacs window and buffer state when that extra context is available.
- Provides an interactive configuration menu for model choice, sandboxing, personality, and other session controls.
- Shows live header-line status for quota and token usage while a session is running.
- Provides a session management mode to preview, search, and restore previous Codex sessions from inside Emacs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Emacs 28.1 or higher
- Codex CLI installed and available on `PATH`
- `transient` installed
- `python3` and `emacsclient` available if you want the optional Emacs MCP bridge

### Installing Codex CLI

See the official app-server documentation: [OpenAI Codex app-server docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server#api-overview).

### Installing the Emacs Package

To install using `use-package` with `:vc` on Emacs 30+:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package codex-ide
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/dgillis/emacs-codex-ide" :rev :newest)
  :bind ("C-c C-;" . codex-ide-menu))
```

To install using `use-package` and [straight.el](https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el):

```emacs-lisp
(use-package codex-ide
  :straight (:type git :host github :repo "dgillis/emacs-codex-ide")
  :bind ("C-c C-;" . codex-ide-menu))
```

After installation, run `M-x codex-ide-menu` or `M-x codex-ide` to start a session for the current project.

## Getting Started

### `codex-ide-menu`

Use `M-x codex-ide-menu` as the main entry point. It opens a transient menu for starting a new session, continuing the most recent session, sending a prompt from the minibuffer, switching to existing buffers, opening buffer lists, and adjusting configuration.

![The main menu is the recommended starting point for everyday Codex IDE commands.](https://github.com/dgillis/emacs-codex-ide/blob/1c0bb00a35c8fcb20e8a30e28cdc56d774267049/screenshots/codex-ide-menu.png)

### `codex-ide-session-mode`

`codex-ide-session-mode` is the buffer interface to Codex. It renders the conversation transcript, keeps the active prompt editable in-place, streams assistant output, turns file references into links, and handles interruption or approval flows from inside Emacs.

Key bindings:

- `C-c RET` submits the active prompt.
- `C-c C-c` or `C-c C-k` interrupts the current response.
- `C-c C-d` opens the session diff buffer.
- `C-M-p` and `C-M-n` move between prompt lines.
- `M-p` and `M-n` cycle prompt history while point is in the active prompt.
- `TAB` and `S-TAB` move between clickable buttons and file links.

### Session diff buffer

Codex IDE can show a canonical diff buffer for each session. Open it with
`C-c C-d` from a session buffer, `M-x codex-ide-session-diff-open`, or from
`M-x codex-ide-menu` with the `D` / `Session diff` entry.

The session diff buffer is derived from `diff-mode`, so normal Emacs diff
navigation and font-locking apply. It is tied to one Codex session and reuses a
stable buffer name ending in `-session-diff`, making it a good companion window
while Codex is editing files.

The buffer has three source states:

- `live`: show the latest or currently running turn diff. Use this while Codex
  is actively making changes and you want a live view of what is being edited.
  Incoming file-change updates refresh the buffer automatically.
- `transcript`: show the diff for the prompt/response at point in the session
  transcript. Use this when reviewing earlier turns or comparing what changed
  at different points in the conversation. Moving point in the session buffer
  updates the diff buffer when the selected turn changes.
- `pinned`: keep showing one selected turn. Use this when you want the diff to
  stay fixed while you move around the transcript or while newer activity
  arrives.

Key bindings in `codex-ide-session-diff-mode`:

- `g` refreshes the diff buffer.
- `l` switches to `live`.
- `t` switches to `transcript`.
- `p` switches to `pinned`.
- `C-c TAB` toggles the file diff at point.
- `C-c C-a` collapses all file diffs.
- `C-c C-e` expands all file diffs.
- `RET` jumps from a diff line to the corresponding source file location when
  Codex IDE can resolve it.

The session diff buffer is separate from static turn diff buffers. Use the
session diff when you want an automatically updating view; use a turn-specific
diff when you want a snapshot.
