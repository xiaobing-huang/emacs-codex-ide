;;; codex-ide-window.el --- Buffer display policy for codex-ide -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2026

;; Author: Duncan Gillis

;;; Commentary:

;; This module owns window and buffer display decisions for codex-ide.
;;
;; It answers questions like:
;;
;; - When a Codex buffer should reuse an existing window versus create a new
;;   one.
;; - How a newly created session should honor the configured split direction.
;; - How to apply focus and dedication rules consistently across callers.
;;
;; Separating these rules from session and transcript control keeps the higher
;; level code focused on lifecycle and transcript concerns instead of scattering
;; `display-buffer', split, and focus policy throughout the codebase.
